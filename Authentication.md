1. hashing

~ Hashing is one way

~ given the output, no one can find out the input

~ changing the input a lit bit changes the output by a lot


2. Encription

4. JWT - json web token

~ A JSON web token(JWT) is JSON Object which is used to securely transfer      information over the web(between two parties). It can be used for an         authentication system and can also be used for information exchange.The token is mainly composed of header, payload, signature. These three parts are separated by dots(.). JWT defines the structure of information we are sending from one party to the another, and it comes in two forms â€“ Serialized, Deserialized. The Serialized approach is mainly used to transfer the data through the network with each request and response. While the deserialized approach is used to read and write data to the web token.

~ Signature can be verify only using password
